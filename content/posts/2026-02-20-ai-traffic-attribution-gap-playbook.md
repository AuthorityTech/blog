At AuthorityTech, we call this the **AI traffic attribution gap**: demand is influenced in answer engines while revenue models still over-credit the final click.

## Key Takeaways
- **127 impressions, 0 clicks** on “ai traffic attribution” in our last-30-day data proves intent exists while packaging and attribution lag.
- **Gartner projects a 25% search behavior shift by 2026** toward non-traditional discovery flows.
- **Zero-click behavior is now the baseline**, not the edge case.

## AI Discovery vs Legacy Dashboarding
| Legacy model | AI-era model |
|---|---|
| Last-click source | Assisted influence |
| Rank tracking | Citation + recommendation rate |
| Channel siloing | Entity-level attribution |
